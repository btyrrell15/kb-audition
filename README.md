# KB Audition

This web application helps simplify the audition process. No more headshots, resume's, and loose papers. A user can register as as company, judge or a performer. The company can add, edit, or delete an audition. The judge can score a performer if they've been invited by a company to judge a specific audition. The performer can register for any of the auditions that are upcoming.
